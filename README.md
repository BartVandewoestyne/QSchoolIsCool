# QSchoolIsCool
Little toy-project that I'm creating for my son and that helps me exercise my
Qt skills.

My son is 5 years old now and he will go to elementary school next year.  He
will need to exercise his math, and I want to exercise my Qt skills.  So that's
why I decided to create this toy-app.

Comments on the architecture and coding style of the code are highly
appreciated!  Let's learn a lot from this!
